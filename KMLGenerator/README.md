# KMLGenerator

An **extremely** simple tool to generate arbitrarily large amounts of random placemark tags in a kml file.

## Usage

Designed to take 2 commandline arguments. First argument is file path of kml to generate, second is number of placemarks:

`KMLGenerator.exe test_2.kml 30000`

## Getting Started

This was built to test one of the many KML/KMZ compatible apps I have written. It is being shared here because it's just interesting enough to be useful to someone else. 

Tested and built in VS2019 community.

### Installing

Build the release file then copy (dll and exe) to wherever you want to store your executable

## Future Improvements

None planed at this time, however, there very well might be other use cases to implement and a general purpose KML generator tool could prove useful in other environments.
